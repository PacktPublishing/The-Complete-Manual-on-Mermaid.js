**Create complex diagrams and beautiful flowcharts easily using text and code**

## What is this book about?
Mermaid lets you represent diagrams using text and code which simplifies the maintenance of complex diagrams. This is a great option for developers as theyâ€™re more familiar with code, rather than using special tools for generating diagrams. Besides, diagrams in code simplify maintenance and ensure that the code is supported by version control systems. In some cases, Mermaid makes refactoring support for name changes possible while also enabling team collaboration for review distribution and updates.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand good and bad documentation, and the art of effective documentation
* Become well-versed with maintaining complex diagrams with ease
* Discover how to draw different types of Mermaid diagrams such as flowcharts, class diagrams, Gantt charts, and more
* Implement Mermaid diagrams in your workflows
* Understand how to set up themes for a Mermaid diagram for an entire site
* Setting up a custom documentation system

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for content generators such as technical writers, developers, architects, business analysts, and managers who want to learn effective documentation or how to effectively represent diagrams using simple text code snippets and extract them. Any familiarity with documentation using markdown would be helpful, but it is not a necessity.

**Knut Sveidqvist**
Knut Sveidqvist has extensive experience of working in the e-commerce industry and currently works as a Frontend Architect at iPiccolo AB. He has also worked as a construction leader at a large Swedish telecom company where he got the idea of creating Mermaid. The development team that he led was good at creating high-quality software and also very document-centric. Once he was struggling to find the original vision document for a diagram attached to a word document and thought that there had to be a better way of doing this and thus started the journey of creating Mermaid.js.

**Ashish Jain**
Ashish Jain has great experience of working in the e-commerce industry, and having led several developer teams - he understands the value of a good documentation. He currently works as a Technical Lead at Nagarro Software and is also a Core Team Member and contributor to the Mermaid.js OSS. Having worked in several software development teams, he has often worked on project documentation and other documented deliverables like functional requirements, solution design etc, where the need to have a simpler way to draw and integrate diagrams in documents was felt. And the moment he was exposed to Mermaid, he was highly impressed with it and associated himself with the project.
